This is FLUX, the Field Line Universal Relaxer, v. 2.3

For full documentation visit the FLUX wiki:
     http://flux.boulder.swri.edu/


FLUX is a prototype MHD solver that is currently able to find
nonlinear force-free fields with an exactly specified topology in a
quasi-static, infinitely conductive, low-beta medium.  Unlike
conventional extrapolation codes, FLUX accepts as input a collection
of field line shapes that do not necessarily have physical meaning but
that do have the correct topology that you want to study.

The FLUX engine relaxes the position of those field lines until they
approximate the physical force-free state with the same topology that you
specified.

FLUX consists of two parts: a relaxation engine, written in C, and a
control interface in Perl.  The control interface is intended to be
used with Perl Data Language (PDL).  If you do not have PDL on your
system, you can get it for free from http://pdl.perl.org.  PDL
compiles "out of the box" on most UNIX systems, and a "native" 
version exists for Microsoft Windows.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are two components to FLUX: a C simulation library (libflux.a)
and a Perl module (Flux.pm, etc). Unfortunately, automake and Perl's
ExtUtils::MakeMaker don't play nicely together.  Additionally, Flux.pm
needs to have libflux.a installed during build, so we build and
install the components separately.

1) The first line builds the simulation library.
2) The second line installs libflux.a and some header files into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/flux, respectively. These locations are currently hard-coded.
3) The third line builds the Perl module (and prepares it to install in the location given by PL_PREFIX).
4) The fourth line installs Flux.pm, etc.
Note the 'sudo' on lines 2 and [if required based on PL_PREFIX] 4

$ make libbuild
$ sudo make libinstall
$ PL_PREFIX=~/local make pdlbuild
$ [sudo] make pdlinstall

IFF both the library and the module are going to be installed in root-owned or user-owned locations, you can shortcut the above with

$ [sudo] [PL_PREFIX=~/local] [FL_PREFIX=~/local] make everything

for example, to install everything into your home directory ~/local/lib, ~/local/include, etc., you could do

$ PL_PREFIX=~/local FL_PREFIX=~/local make everything


--------

This is the FLUX top-level directory.

Subdirectories include:
        lib -- the central libflux.a core simulation library
		    (this gets installed into /usr/local/lib/)

	doc -- some docs (deprecated; see http://flux.boulder.swri.edu 
		for more up-to-date information.)

	include -- 'c' header files 
	           (these get installed into /usr/local/include/flux/)
	
        pdl -- PDL glue code and perl modules

	pdl/PDL -- PDL autoload subroutines

RELEASE NOTES FOR v2.2 (22-Nov-2008):
  - Mass is actively tracked in the data structures
  - Binary save files are supported; all files are auto-gzipped if they have a '.gz' extension
  - First-stage parallelization appears functional -- the code can spawn to make use of multiple CPU cores on the local machine.
  - Interpolation of all scientific values onto arbitrary locations is now possible.
  - New reconnection criteria make reconnection "in the wrong direction" much less common.
  - Multiple bug fixes in the perl interface code
  - Data structure labels can now be edited via the perl hash interface.
  - There is better support for motion and interaction of flux concentrations.

RELEASE NOTES FOR v2.1 (3-Apr-2008):
	
  - Many, many bug fixes
  - Photospheres and other refs handled correctly by hash interface
  - Reworked Perl hash interface to eliminate stale pointers altogether
  - Added Hilbert ditherer
  - Better reconnection support
  - Better auto-open support

RELEASE NOTES FOR v2.0 (1-Nov-2007):

  - Now includes reconnection via the "reconnect" Flux::World method
  - Updated and validated force laws
  - Full plasmoid support
  - Full open-field boundary support, including omega and U loop
	interactions with the boundary
  - Includes a Floyd-Steinberg ditherer for footpoint placement
  - Includes techniques ("ductions") for moving footpoints in 
	time-dependent simulations
  - Better control over relaxation parameters
  - Emergence/cancellation support
  - Better interaction with Perl:
	- Support for all fields via the Perl hash interface
	- No memory leaks (I think)
	- No stale pointers (I think)

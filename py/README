# FLUX Python Tools

Here find some assembled Python tools for interfacing with and interpreting results from the FLUX core PDL code.

## Plotting tools
- plt-world.py - Plots a single snapshot of a fluxon world
- plt-relax.py - Plots a sequence of relaxation steps for a fluxon world

Other tools to be added after this initial test commit.

## Installation requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- SunPy
- MayaVi

Note that the MayaVi / VTK installation is a bit more involved, and will be updated fully in time. The Enthought Python installation claims to have all of this bundled, and may be tested in the meantime.

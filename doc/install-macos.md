# macOS Installation Instructions

These instructions were created by adapting the linux conda install to macOS. Please let us know if anything breaks!
Extra troubleshooting steps are listed at the bottom.

## 1. Get Conda Environment Manager
Depending on your mac's architecture, either get
```sh
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
bash ~/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

or

``` sh
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash ~/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the prompts:
- Hold down the arrow key and then accept terms.
- Accept Conda activation at startup.
- Exit and reconnect to the SSH session/ shell session.

## 2. Create Conda Environment and Get Dependencies

```sh
conda create -n fluxenv
conda activate fluxenv
conda install -c conda-forge c-compiler gsl perl perl-app-cpanminus perl-extutils-makemaker make cmake automake autoconf libtool m4 patch libxcrypt gnuplot cairo pango qt pfsspy sqlite rich timeout-decorator
```

Confirm installation by typing `y` when prompted.

## 3. Install the Perl Data Language (PDL) and Dependencies

```sh
cpanm Alien::Build::Plugin::Gather::Dino Capture::Tiny Chart::Gnuplot Config::IniFiles Devel::CheckLib File::HomeDir File::Map File::ShareDir File::ShareDir::Install File::Which Inline Inline::C Inline::Python List::MoreUtils Math::GSL Math::GSL::Alien Math::Interpolate Math::Interpolator Math::RungeKutta Moo::Role Net::SSLeay PDL PDL::GSL PDL::GSL::INTEG PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot PDL::Graphics::Simple Parallel::ForkManager Term::ReadKey Test::Builder Text::CSV local::lib
```

If the system struggles with `File`, try:

```sh
export LDFLAGS=""
export CFLAGS="-O2"
export PERL_LDFLAGS=""
export PERL_CFLAGS="-O2"
```

If `Inline::C` isnâ€™t found, run:

```sh
cpanm Inline::C
```

## 4. Get FLUX

Clone and configure Flux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lowderchris/fluxon-mhd.git
cd fluxon-mhd
make condaflux
```

## 5. Get Fluxpype Wrapper (To run FLUX with)

```sh
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/GillySpace27/fluxpype.git
cd fluxpype
pip install -e .
```

If the GCC version is too old, fix it with:

```sh
export CC=$(which gcc)
export CXX=$(which g++)
```

## 6. Configure the `config.ini` File

```sh
nano fluxpype/config.ini
```

Set the code to do your desired run using the documentation (TBD)

Run the configuration run script:

```sh
python fluxpype/config_runner.py
```
- For the paths to work out, the config runner must be called from one directory above the file.


## FAQs & Troubleshooting
- If an error says that a perl file cannot be found, make sure there isn't a syntax error somewhere in that file, because it will say it cannot find it when it means it cannot compile it.

- If gnuplot is not detected correctly in PDL, try the following, and if it works, put this line into either the conda activation script or the bashrc file:
    - ```export GNUPLOT_BINARY=$(realpath $(which gnuplot))```

- If GSL is not found, use
    - ```conda install gsl```
    - ```cpanm --notest PDL::GSL```

- If net-SSLeay fails to install, try this
    - ```conda install openssl=1.1.1```
    - ```cpanm PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot```

- If Math::GSL::Alien fails to install, try
    - ```conda install gsl```
    - ```cpanm --notest PDL::GSL```


- if the wrong cpanm is getting in the way, delete it using the wrong path as follows
    - ```export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed 's|/Users/cgilbert/perl5/perlbrew/bin:||')```
    - then try to use the huge cpanm installation command above
    - then run the set_paths.sh file
    - activate the environment
    - make everything

- if the paths seem completely wrong, try these in the fluxon-mhd directory
    - ```make uninstall```
    - ```make clean```

- if the error is: Can't locate Alien/Gnuplot.pm in @INC
    - ```cpanm Alien::Gnuplot```

- if fluxpype cannot find the run file, check the paths at the top of ```config.ini``` to make sure that the path is correct.

- If Flux.pm isn't found at the end of the flux install, try:

```sh
export PERL5LIB=$(dirname $(find $CONDA_PREFIX -name Flux.pm)):$PERL5LIB
make everything
```

- To manually set the prefixes for a conda installation before using the makefile:

```sh
export PL_PREFIX="$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/perl5/site_perl"
export FL_PREFIX="$CONDA_PREFIX"
```
- To confirm installation success:

```sh
perl -e "use Flux;"
```
